# React + Vite

# Infinite Scrolling

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the implementation of infinite scrolling using React hooks. The application dynamically renders a list of div elements as the user scrolls down the page.

## How it Works

The application uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to manage state and side effects respectively. When the component mounts, an event listener is added to the `scroll` event of the window. As the user scrolls down the page, the application detects when the scroll position reaches the bottom of the page. At that point, it updates the state to render additional div elements, simulating infinite scrolling behavior.
